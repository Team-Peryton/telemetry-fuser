# TODO

## Critical

- Actually Read and Write to Serial ports
- `Serial.print()` or `Serial.write()`

## Important

- Explore buffer size
- Check which pin the Teensy uses for the SD card
- Test every single function
- Maybe redesign packets so that `peek()` can be used to identify the destination

## Useful

- Migrate from `String` to `char` to improve performance

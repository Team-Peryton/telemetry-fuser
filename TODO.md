# TODO

## Critical

- Test every single function
- Queue library requires pointers. Check that the queue entries aren't all identical

## Important

- Maybe redesign packets so that `peek()` can be used to identify the destination
- Does `File.println()` crash if the file was not opened?

## Useful

- Migrate from `String` to `char` to improve performance
